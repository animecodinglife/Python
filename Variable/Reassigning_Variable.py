# Reassigning Variable:: as the word variable implies Python variable can be readily changed.

# Being able to reassign is useful because throughout the course of a program you may need to accept user-generated values into already initialized variable...

# Assign x to be an integer

x=76
print(x)

# Reassign x to be a string

x= "Saamyy"
# print(x)


# The assign in the variable y and assign it with the value of an integer and then reassign the variable x assigned if this time with the value of a string.
# 
# 

y=34
y="ford"

print(x) #(Reassigning variable can be useful in some cases, but you will want to be aware of the readability of your code and work to make your program as clear as possble)
